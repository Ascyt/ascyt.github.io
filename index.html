    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I love to code, mostly in the Unity3D framework. I have a lot of plans for projects, but since school is taking away a lot of my free time, it's hard to focus on them. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I mostly code in C# and in Python. I also know a good amount of C, C++ and Web-developement (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). If you ever need a website, Discord bot, console application, or anything similar, hit me up!
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm cis and male. Since I don't really care you can use any pronoun you want, but I might have problems trying to figure out if you're referring to me if you don't use 'he' or 'they'. 
        </li>

            Despite German being my native language, I also have great English skills, mostly having learned it from the internet. Other than than I'm also able to speak a little bit of Spanish, which I've learned using Duolingo (which I quit because they stupidly removed the option to use the keyboard, seriously bring that back I you), and a sad amount of French, given that I've had it in school for two years.
        </li>
        <li>
            I like to practice typing for fun, mostly using <a href="https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=ascyt", target="_blank">typeracer</a> and <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/user/2057874/", target="_blank">10FastFingers</a>. I've been using the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/1200px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png", target="_blank">Dvorak keyboard layout</a> since April 2021, and am currently sitting at around 100 words per minute.

        <li>
            I don't have a very wide taste in music, I mostly just listen to EDM (more precisely, Progressive House). Since most of the artists I frequently listen to are pretty unknown, you're probably not going to have heard of any of the songs I mostly listen to, but here are my top ones if you're curious:<br><br><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4JWSOPMo4rrJlcpWHh5KHI?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

            I'm a friendly and accepting guy. If you want to chat, please feel free to hit me up, I appreciate every DM I get!
